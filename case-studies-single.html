						<h3>Ssali Patrick<small>Founder / Head of Product Development</small></h3>
						<p align="justify"> Ssali Patrick has vast knowledge and experience in computer programing. Python programing language being his main strength.  His python skills range from software &amp; web development to web scraping, server programing, network administrator, data manipulation, data analysis, data visualizations and so many more.
							His career started at as an It assistant at Siemens Uganda, where he spent 3yrs. it’s from here he honed his computer and software programing skills mostly in Python programing language. Through excellent mentorship, his experience grew and he was able to solve data related problems using Siemens data sets and building systems end to end from where he was later taken up by Puini international a network marketing company.
							At Puini he transitioned to customer web product management and he worked a total of two years as part of the data infrastructure team and overseeing some of the data driven products at PUINI INTERNATIONAL. The products differed by company and business line, but the heart of the roles being the need to empathize with users, understand their problems, formulate solutions to those problems, and work cross-functionally to take those solutions from conception to completion. But this required rigorous collection of data as well as a coordinated system and a highly professional team of engineers to make sense out the data which was essential for the organization to accurately plan, fund and evaluate the organizations activities.
							His experience at Puini international had a very profound effect on his data engineering skills as the biggest part of his role as a developer was working with a data team. Puini wanted to know the visitors on their website per day, and it would use this information to figure out what locations to focus their marketing efforts and also to understand if their marketing efforts were working properly. To archive these metrics his role was to construct a data pipeline to parse the web log files and analyze them, which he successfully accomplished.
